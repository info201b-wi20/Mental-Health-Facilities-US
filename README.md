# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

Domain of interest
As we've discussed, data science can expose underlying patterns in any domain that uses or collects data (which is nearly any domain). Anything from European Family Royalties (Links to an external site.) to how people spend their days (Links to an external site.), data can expose interesting (and actionable) patterns. In this section, you'll identify a domain that you are interested in (e.g., music, education, dance, immigration -- any field of your interest) and answer the following questions in your README.md file:

Domain of Interest: Mental Health

Why are you interested in this field/domain?
Mental health is a huge topic that has consistently been overlooked despite how widespread the issue of mental health disorders is. There is also a lack of treatment and information for many mental health disorders in a multitude of countries. People across different cultures, languages, socioeconomic classes and ages but not enough individuals talk about it. Therefore, we wanted to address this stigmatized topic and analyze the data for any new insight into mental health issues.

What other examples of data driven projects have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?
1. https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health
2. https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/
3.

What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?
1. Are there differences in mental health between individuals in each state within the US?

We strongly suggest that you complete this section first, discussing what you might want to learn, then move forward with the data discovery process.

Finding Data
We are lucky enough to live in a time when there is lots of publicly available data made possible by governments, journalists, academics, and companies. In this section, you will identify and download at least 3 sources of data related to your domain of interest described above (into a folder you create called data/). You won't be required to use all of these sources, but it will give you practice discovering data. If your data is made available through a Web API, you don't need to download it. For each source of data, provide the following information:

Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
1. N-MHSS-2018: https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-dataset/national-mental-health-services-survey-2018-n-mhss-2018-ds0001-nid18767
This data set was downloaded with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Archive.
2. Connecticut Mental Health Survey (2015-2016): http://data.ctdata.org/visualization/mental-health?v=table&f={%22Variable%22:%20%22Mental%20Health%22,%20%22Region%22:%20%22Connecticut%22,%20%22Measure%20Type%22:%20%22Percent%22,%20%22Year%22:%20%222015-2016%22}
