# Aggregate Table of Summary criteria: (Ann's part)
# The second file you should save in your scripts/ directory should contain a function that takes in a dataset as a parameter, and returns a table of aggregate information about it. It must perform a groupby operation to show a dimension of the dataset as grouped by a particular feature (column). We expect the included table to:
  
# - Have well formatted column names
# - Only contain relevant information
# - Be intentionally sorted in a meaningful way
# You must also describe why you included the table, and what information it reveals.
